I'm a firm believer that words mean what they are understood to mean, so I am going to refrain from saying that most people define microservices incorrectly, and instead say that the definition of a microservice that is commonly used is not very useful. Here I will present what I believe to be a more useful definition of microservices and explain why.

Notes:
- [ ] Nothing to do with deployment topology (lambda, webpack react apps etc)
- [ ] AWS article about FooService moving to a monolith
- [ ] Isn't this SOA?
- [ ] tree look like a bonsai vs bonsai look like a tree (microservice look like a monolith)
- [ ] what was the goal here anyway?
- [ ] purely about scaling teams, nothing to do with (runtime) perf and scalability
- [ ] theory of modular software design
- [ ] distributed ball of mud (bad monolith to even worse microservice)
